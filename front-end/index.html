                <h2 class="h-secondary center">what is BMI?</h2>
                <p class="center">Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used measurement that helps determine whether an
                    individual has a healthy body weight relative to their height. It is a simple and quick way to
                    categorize people into different weight groups, which can provide insights into potential health
                    risks associated with being underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</p>
                <h2 class="h-secondary center">How is BMI calculated?</h2>
                <p class="center">BMI is calculated using the following formula:</p>
                <p class="center">BMI = weight(kg) / height(cm sq)</p><br>
                <p class="center">Alternatively, if you prefer to use pounds and inches:</p>
                <p class="center">BMI = weight(lbs) x 703 / height(inches sq)</p><br>
